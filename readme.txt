WPMU sitewide plugin to display sitewide blog activity. Displays user logins, new comments and new posts as links.

== Description ==

WPMU sitewide plugin to display sitewide blog activity. Displays user logins, new comments and new posts as links.

Since this plugin allows you to monitor all activity sitewide, it will be very easy to quickly locate spam blogs and their activities.

Unlike the "premium" plugins, Blog Activity and User Activity, this plugin displays information about _what_ is happening, not just that there is _something_ happening.

Has an uninstall option to completely remove it from the database. 

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and copy the zip contents (including directory) into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin sitewide through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Screenshots ==

1. Main activity monitor tab
2. Settings tab
